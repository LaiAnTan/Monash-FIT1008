# Abstract Data Types

An ADT provides information regarding its semantics, but not on the implementation (i.e. implementation is ignored).

Semantics (i.e. behavior) is known:

- possible values of the type
- operations on the type

Implementation is ignored:

- how the values are stored (underlying data structure)
- how the implementation works

e.g. stack, list (vector), queue ...

## Advantages of ADTs

- Simplicty
- Easy to mantain
- Flexibility & Reusability
- Portability

## Data Strcutures

The particular way in which data is physically organised in memory.

Only index access operation is provided.

e.g. array, node
