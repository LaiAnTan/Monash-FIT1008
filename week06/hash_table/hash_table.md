# Hash Table

An ADT that provides efficient adding, searching and deletion operations.

Each item stored in a hash table must have a unique key.

## Operations

- add
- search
- delete

With a perfect hash table implementation, these operations are expected to run in constant time, i.e. O(1). However, they can still reach O(n) if the hash table is not constructed well.

## Use Cases

- tracking the number of each item
- data caching
