# Binary Search Trees

A binary tree with a few more properties:

- each node has a unique key
- all keys in the **left subtree of a node are less than the key of the node**
- all keys in the **right subtree of a node are greater than the key of the node**

Advantages of BST:

- good for searching and for inserting and deleting
- can be traversed in particular orders
